    "### A1: Research Question\n",
    "For this task, my research question is \"Can I effectively predict customer Tenure via decision trees using the data available?\". I will be using the Churn dataset for this assessment. Tenure is the foundation for sustainable and long-term financial success for telecommunication companies. The longer individuals retain subscription to one company, the more likely it is that they have developped a strong service model, great customer satisfaction rates, and will naturally grow through online user reviews and word-of-mouth recommendations. This growth is ideal for an industry where competition is fierce and each company has to undercut each other via loss leading service packages, as customers can very easily be persuaded in dropping one company for another with a simple phone call. \n",
    "\n",
    "By making predictions of customer tenure through the collected data available, these companies can assess the longevity of their customer relations based on existing features, identifying whether or not current service packages require improvement for customer satistfaction. This will ultimately result in effective resource allocation, dictating exactly when the company may be in danger of customers ending their tenure."

    "### A2: Goal\n",
    "The question I pose is similar in nature to the one used in D208's Task 1. I have attempted to develop a regression model that could accurately establish known and relevant relationships between independant variables and the depandant variable Tenure. Within the multiple linear regression model I created, I found that the resulting analysis did not conform to the assumptions necessary to deem the model acceptable and applicable in a corporate environment. My goal for this assessment is to try again using decision trees this time to build a machine learning model that can help the company predict its customers tenure, allowing them to generate useful insights into variables that are negatively impacting the tenure rates."

    "### B1: Classification Method\n",
    "The classification method I have chosen is a decision tree. This classification method is structured like a tree, consisting of nodes in heirarchal format that classify datapoints and sort them as information is passed down the tree. Each node serves as a test for some attribute such as \"Does the customer have online protection? How many children does the customer have? etc...\", splitting said node into two or more sub-nodes based on homogeny (similarity). The tree will use multiple algorithms to perform these tests recursively until the decision criteria has been met (Chauhan, 2022). From this, the tree will identify the nodes and selected criteria to identify branch pathways that result in an appropriately predicted tenure length to its best ability, this final resulting node is referred to as the leaf node. Using this method, I am aiming to build a model that will be able to assess a customer given their collected data and deduce their estimated tenure, the company can then utilize these predictions for cost-benefit analyses on how to proceed to increase customer retention."

    "### B2: Decision Tree Assumption\n",
    "The major assumption of decision trees is that it is a non-parametric algorithm, the data can be collected from samples that do not follow specific distributions. This means that the data we are working with for this algorithm is not restricted to any one dimension, the decision tree can deal with linear, non-linear data, categorical data, ordinal data all the same (Datacamp, 2023). Its multidimensional nature of decision trees allow for minimal cleaning in order to start building the model, but it is also able to handle high variety of data with less computational requirements and solid accuracy.

    "For this assessment I will be using Python. This language was chosen due to its ability to handle a wide variety of data analytical processes, large sets of data, and ease of use for data transformation, cleaning, and visualization. Many python packages are tailored to specific tasks with intuitive naming conventions, giving me efficiency in my analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The packages I have chosen to apply for my assessment, as well as their purpose are as follows:\n",
    "- Pandas: for importing my dataset into a dataframe, allows for manipulation of data, columns, datatypes.\n",
    "- NumPy: for conducting mathematical operations and array manipulation.\n",
    "- Matplotlib & Seaborn: packages designed for visualization of distribution as it has multiple chart types.\n",
    "- scikit-learn: provides several tools necessary to conduct my decision tree model. Elaborated on below.\n",
    "- sklearn train_test_split: used to split the dataset between training and testing data. GridSearchCV will be used to identify optimal values for maximizing performance\n",
    "- sklearn DecisionTreeRegressor: used to generate the decision tree.\n",
    "- several sklearn metrics libraries such as: r2_score, accuracy_score, mean_squared_error that are used to evaluate our decision tree algorithm's accuracy."

    "While I stated that decision tree algorithms are ones that can deal with a high dimensionality of data, evaluation still needs to be done on numeric data even if my independant variable is categorical. Thus, to reiterate from my previous task's paper; categorical data will be re-expressed ordinally as 1 and 0 so that it may be used within my analysis. For binary categorical variables, I will be re-expressing their 'yes' and 'no' answers as 1 and 0. For categorical variables with more than 2 responses, I will preform one-hot encoding to generate dummy columns in the 1, 0 answer format, ensuring that I drop the first column to prevent any potential problems with multicollinearity from arising. I will largely be re-using the independant variables that remained from my D208 task 1 paper in my final multiple linear regression model as the variables isolated during my analysis demonstrated the most promise in a statistically significant relationship to my dependant variable."

    "Using the calculated ideal parameters of optimal maximum nodes of 9, and minimum sample leaf size of 5, the testing set's mean squared error (MSE) was determined to be 2.9. The value represents the square of the deviance magnitude from the predicted unit's true accuracy. As a better idea of what this value means for our model, the root of the mean squared error (RMSE) was determined to be 1.7, and this represents a standard error of 1.7 months for a customer's tenure. For the context of our assessment here, this is a very low value given that tenure can range from 1 month to 72 months. Overall, the model demonstrates a strong ability to predict a customer's total tenure within 1 to 2 months of accuracy. Ultimately, I cannot say for certain if this RMSE is an ideal low value as I lack the domain knowledge to ascertain its validity in the telecommunications industry but for my assessment I believe this is an appropriate result."

This is further supported by the RMSE value determined being very low, as such, it is strongly indicated that my decision tree model is useful in predicting a customer's tenure.

    "However, overfitting comes with the consequence of having difficulty adapting to new or unknown data because it is only really good at assessing *currently available data*. As such, while it is perfectly suitable for assessing current customer churn rates, what if the telecom corporation would like to assess potential tenure rates for new clientele. Say for example, the company would like to target an entirely new market base, a new demographic, or maybe aim to poach customers from another telecom company. They are likely then looking to identify the likely revenue output to weigh against the cost of customer acquisition to establish forecasted budgets and determine feasability. This model may not be applicable for that because it only demonstrates predictive accuracy on the customer data available *within* the company, customers who may have an entirely different mindset, values, or appeal to the brand. I would strongly recommend that before this model can be used for external assessmnet, it has to be validated against either industry standards, or if possible, another company's dataset. That way, the company can be certain if this model will be applicable to new unknown data, rather than just the dataset it has been given."
