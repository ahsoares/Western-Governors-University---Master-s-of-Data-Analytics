    "Dataset 1: I have primarily selected WGU's churn dataset, a dataset for a telecom company that provides internet and mobile services across the United States. The dataset contains a given month's information on 10,000 customers including customer age, tenure, income, service package selection, payment information, and churn status. Throughout the assessment I will refer to this dataset as WGU Telecom Co. [This dataset can be found here](https://access.wgu.edu/ASP3/aap/content/k8gj49f8sichedufutms.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset 2: For comparison, I have chosen to select a dataset that closely mirrors the information found within the WGU churn dataset. This dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and contains information on 7043 customers within a telecommunications company based in California. Said information is much like WGU Telecom Co.'s with similar customer information, for the period of Q3. [This dataset can be found here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) (Kaggle, 2018).\n",

    "**Data Cleaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "While not required for this performance assessment, I wanted to clean my datasets and concatenate them into one single csv for more efficiency when I import it into Tableau. I want to ensure that are no null or duplicate values, I also want to remove columns that do not exist in both datasets to limit the information only to comparative values, and I will change the column titles to match pandas standard naming conventions, so that concatenation will not result in extra unnecessary columns being created in my combined csv dataset."

I have used the churn dataset many times in my past performance assessments but this is the first time I get to compare it against an industry benchmark to assess key metrics as an internal stakeholder would. When constructing the paired dataset, I wanted to make sure there the comparison was being performed as directly as possible, which meant isolating only the shared features between both datasets to reduce bloat and shrink the dataset into directly comparable metrics. In doing so, I have built a dataset that provides exploration of customer demographic structure and has visualizations/filters available for use in comparing key performance metrics so that executive leaders can ascertain industry trends, competitor advantages, and assess current performance to a direct competitor, all in an interactive platform that conveys important insights at a glance."

    "The variables noted from the external dataset happened to demonstrate much similarity in the product offerings of WGU's churn dataset. Within, I noted that both companies offer the same internet services such as DSL and fiber optic. Additionally, payment processing, contract type, tenure, churn status, as well as extra packages such as device protection and online backup were present as well. Due to the similarity in service offerings, I knew this would be the perfect selection for industry comparison as utilizing a direct competitor allows for assessment of benchmarks in success. Using both of these datasets in conjunction has allowed me to identify insights into common industry norms (such as the proportion of internet type selected), and performance status in comparison to another similar company (such as the ratio between customers churning), which helps in knowing if the WGU Telecom Company performs uniquely from industry standards."

    "### C3: Decision-Making Support\n",
    "I have established the **Retention Analysis** dashboard as the page that grants actionable supporting evidence for decision makers. Within, you will find a treemap that demonstrates the highest tenure lengths yielded per service contract offering, showing the internet type with the highest average tenure in the darkest color as DSL, the internet type with the next highest retention is shown in a lighter color as FiberOptic, and so on. This treemap can be utilized by management to identify which internet service they could structure an advertising campaign around to encourage new customers to subscribe to. Another data representation that grants very useful insights into potential retention boosting features would be stacked chart in the Retention Analysis dashboard representing the number of customers at each tenure length, going from 1 month to 72. We can see that both companies' customers follow a relatively similar trend, then at the highest tenure length the graph diverges, showing that the competitor company pulls ahead of WGU Telecom Co. in customers who have 72 months of tenure. Upon utilizing the filter on the right side of the dashboard to isolate the Automatic payment method we immediately see that customers who utilize the Automatic payment type are the cause for this, as this trend does not exist within customers that use Electronic Check and Mailed Check for payment. This allows for management to again identify trends leading to better tenure rates and generate targeted marketing campaigns to encourage subscription with these benchmarks."

Additionally in the retention analysis tab I have provided a payment method filter to isolate churn/tenure rates by payment method, and another bar-based tenure length filter, which the user may use to adjust the scale of the tenure assessment chart.

    "The goal of my dashboards is to tell multiple stories of how WGU's Telecom Company compares to another competitor within the industry to assess trends, identify areas of improvement, and determine what the competitor may be doing to achieve higher customer retention. The first area I noticed potential to convey a space for improvement was within the customer demographics tab. Within, I noticed that upon filtering between WGU's telecom dataset and the competitor dataset is that the monthly charge rates differred severely between WGU Telecom and its competitor, while I don't have the domain knowledge to assess the cost-benefit analysis of WGU Telecom having a lower monthly rate than its current amount, it's certainly a data representation that supports looking further at bringing more appealing to customers long-term. Another area that conveys the current churn trends between WGU Telecom and its competitor can be found in the retention analysis tab. In the left of the dashboard, users will see a comparative bar graph displaying the ratio between customers that have churned vs. those that have not within the dataset period. The story I wanted to convey here is that it appears, based on the datasets available for analysis, that the churn ratio present within the data seems to be common within the industry, and that WGU Telecom Co. is not performing at a subpar level since the ratio is the exact same between WGU and its competitor."

Visual representations such as the customer demographics dashboard can give them a quick and easy way to review what the popular selection trends are among current customers. This audience analysis can be adapted on a smaller basis to. Instead of high-level management, this analysis can be done on a divisional basis to focus and divide resources and delegate management to assess performance in their own way, giving middle-level management the freedom to perform the analysis at the ground level and pass that information up the chain instead."

Furthermore, another element of storytelling I have employed for this presentation was to focus on information that was relevant and impactful for the stakeholders. I decided to keep most of my presentation, as well as the ending recommendations, focused on actionable insights that will impact the bottom line; executive management is most concerned with financial impact and improvement, so I kept my analysis focused on this to present only the pertinent data that decision-makers would be most interested in learning to engage the audience."
